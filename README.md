# This Story Does Not Exist

Welcome to **This Story Does Not Exist**, where every choice you make writes a story only you can tell. You are both the reader and the written.

Hi, I’m Ethan Thornberg! I built this project because I believe storytelling should be as limitless as your imagination. This project is my way of combining AI and creativity to build something truly unique. 

## Overview

This Story Does Not Exist is an AI-powered text adventure game that adapts dynamically to your choices. Every decision influences a continuously evolving narrative, ensuring that no two playthroughs are ever the same.

- **Immersive Narrative:** Dive into an adaptive storyline that responds to every decision you make.
- **Dynamic World-Building:** Begin by describing your world—be it a bustling city, a quiet forest, or something entirely new—and watch the AI generate a rich, detailed environment.
- **Interactive Gameplay:** Input your actions via text (with helpful auto-suggestions) and let the AI narrate the unfolding adventure.
- **Persistent Memories:** The game remembers your choices and adapts the story accordingly, using a detailed memory system that balances full detail with summarized context.
- **Classic Fantasy Adventure (Test Mode):** Our initial setup uses a classic fantasy adventure framework, paving the way for future endless narrative possibilities.
